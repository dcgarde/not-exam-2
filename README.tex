\begin{document}

\maketitle
Complete the problems listed below. There are automated tests to check almost all answers.


\emph{Do NOT modify the test code in any way with the exception of uncommenting the code in the last GradeCalculator test!}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the application by running "Exam2Application". Write the code required so
that when a user clicks the "Add Interest" button, a new research interest is
created and added to the list of interests. The new interest should have its
name taken from whatever text is in the adjacent text box. The new interest
should \uline{not} be added to the professor.
\item When an interest is added to the professor, it should be removed from the
interest list. Fix the code so that the interest is removed when dragged to
the professor.
\item The "I am bored!" button currently does nothing. Add code to the application
so that the button calls the "dropInterests" method in the "Professor" class,
and then clears the list of interests for the professor (NOT the left hand
list of unassigned interests).
\item Write or modify code so that the tests in the GradeCalculatorTest file pass.
Note that you will need to uncomment portions of the second test first.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Bonus:}
\label{sec:org7161097}
\begin{itemize}
\item Modify the code so that the Bonus button does not move. When the button is clicked, it should print "Give me 5 points!" to the console.
\end{itemize}
